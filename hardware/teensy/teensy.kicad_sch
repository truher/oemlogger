You may notice that each hole has been shifted either up or down by 0.005 of an inch from it's more standard position (which is a perfectly straight line).  This slight alteration caused the pins (the squares in the middle) to touch the edges of the holes.  Because they are alternating, it causes a \"brace\" to hold the component in place.  0.005 has proven to be the perfect amount of \"off-center\" position when using our standard breakaway headers. Although looks a little odd when you look at the bare footprint, once you have a header in there, the alteration is very hard to notice.  Also,if you push a header all the way into place, it is covered up entirely on the bottom side." (id 7) (at 0 0 0)
